            <h3>Cancer</h3>
            <p>Cancer refers to any one of a large number of diseases characterized by the development of abnormal cells
                that divide uncontrollably and have the ability to infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. Cancer
                often has the ability to spread throughout your body.</p>

            <h3>Diabetes</h3>
            <p>With diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it as well as it should. When there
                isn't enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your
                bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and
                kidney disease.</p>

            <h3>Bone Disease</h3>
            <p>Bone diseases can make bones easy to break. Different kinds of bone problems include: Low bone density
                and osteoporosis, which make your bones weak and more likely to break. Osteogenesis imperfecta makes
                your bones brittle.</p>

                <p>Drink Water regularly : You'll feel less hungry and may even lose weight. You'll probably experience
                    more comfortable digestion (less heartburn). Bowel movements might be easier and more regular. Your
                    teeth and gums will be healthier and more resilient.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The human body comprises around 60% water.</p>

                <p>It’s commonly recommended that you drink eight 8-ounce (237-mL) glasses of water per day (the 8×8
                    rule).</p>

                <p>Although there’s little science behind this specific rule, staying hydrated is important.</p>

                <p>Here are 7 evidence-based health benefits of drinking plenty of water.</p>
                <p>Your brain is strongly influenced by your hydration status.

                    Studies show that even mild dehydration, such as the loss of 1–3% of body weight, can impair many
                    aspects of brain function.

                    In a study in young women, researchers found that fluid loss of 1.4% after exercise impaired both
                    mood and concentration. It also increased the frequency of headaches .

                    Many members of this same research team conducted a similar study in young men. They found that
                    fluid loss of 1.6% was detrimental to working memory and increased feelings of anxiety and fatigue
                    .

                    A fluid loss of 1–3% equals about 1.5–4.5 pounds (0.5–2 kg) of body weight loss for a person
                    weighing 150 pounds (68 kg). This can easily occur through normal daily activities, let alone during
                    exercise or high heat.</p>

            <div class="exersize">
                <p>Exercise is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday health, including older adults. Experts
                    say seniors should be as active as possible. If you are an older adult, exercise can help you live a
                    longer, healthier life.</p>
                <p>&#8226; It improves your strength. This helps you stay independent.</p>
                <p>&#8226; It improves your balance. This prevents falls.</p>
                <p>&#8226; It gives you more energy.</p>
                <p>&#8226; It prevents or delays diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, or osteoporosis.</p>
                <p>&#8226; It can improve your mood and fight off depression.</p>
                <p>&#8226; It may improve cognitive function (how your brain works).</p>

            <div class="yoga">
                <p>As we age, it’s important to incorporate physical activity into our daily routines to help maintain a
                    healthy lifestyle. With a regular exercise routine, seniors will feel more energetic and can help
                    manage the aches and pains that come with aging. This leads to a more independent life where you’re
                    staying safer and feeling your best.</p>

                <p>Yoga has been called one of the best forms of exercise for older adults. Over time and with the
                    proper classes, seniors can improve their flexibility and balance, enhance their strength and boost
                    their mood.</p>

            <p>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p>There are a number of treatments available to help you manage and treat your diabetes. Everyone is
                different, so treatment will vary depending on your own individual needs.
                If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to use insulin to treat your diabetes. You take the insulin by
                injection or by using a pump.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>If you have Type 2 diabetes, you may have to use insulin or tablets, though you might initially be able
                to treat your diabetes by eating well and moving more.</p>

            &nbsp;
            <p>If you have another type of diabetes, your treatment options may be different. Speak to your healthcare
                professional, or call our helpline if you’re not sure.</p>

            <p>Bisphosphonates are usually the first choice for osteoporosis treatment. These include:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Alendronate (Fosamax), a weekly pill</p>
            <p>Risedronate (Actonel), a weekly or monthly pill</p>
            <p>Ibandronate (Boniva), a monthly pill or quarterly intravenous (IV) infusion</p>
            <p>Zoledronic acid (Reclast), an annual IV infusion</p>
            <p>Another common osteoporosis medication is denosumab (Prolia, Xgeva). Unrelated to bisphosphonates,
                denosumab might be used in people who can't take a bisphosphonate, such as some people with reduced
                kidney function.</p>
